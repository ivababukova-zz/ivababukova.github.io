        "This trend of lower turnout for more educated is also visible in figure one, where the turnout for the most educated isnâ€™t (although not very predictable) is generally on the lower end of the turnout, whereas as the less educated consistently tend towards higher turnout.\n" +
        "One phenomenon which may just be an artifact of the data, or is more significant, is that there appear to be two separate groups to the data, one above the other, with a gap in between. We could not attribute any specific reasoning for it, but it is a curiosity worth further thought."
